3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Application

Canvas AI Studio is a client-side web application with the following security characteristics:

#### Data Storage

- **Local Only**: All project data stored in browser localStorage
- **No Server**: No server-side data storage or processing
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data

#### API Integration

- **Direct Connection**: Communicates directly with Google Gemini API
- **User Keys**: API keys managed entirely by users
- **No Proxy**: No intermediate servers handling API requests

#### Privacy

- **No Tracking**: No analytics or user tracking
- **No Telemetry**: No data collection or transmission
- **Open Source**: Full transparency of code and functionality

### Potential Security Concerns

#### API Key Management

- **Client-Side Storage**: API keys stored in browser localStorage
- **Visibility**: Keys visible in browser developer tools
- **Recommendation**: Users should treat keys as sensitive data

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Input Sanitization**: Text inputs are properly escaped
- **Content Security**: No dynamic script execution
- **Safe Rendering**: Canvas rendering uses safe APIs

#### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

- **API Calls**: Direct calls to Google APIs with proper CORS handling
- **No Proxy**: No CORS proxy servers that could intercept data

### Best Practices for Users

#### API Key Security

1. **Keep Keys Private**: Never share API keys publicly
2. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check API usage in Google AI Studio
3. **Rotate Keys**: Periodically generate new API keys
4. **Secure Storage**: Consider using password managers for key storage

#### Browser Security

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always access the application over HTTPS
2. **Keep Updated**: Use latest browser versions
3. **Private Browsing**: Consider private/incognito mode for sensitive work
4. **Clear Data**: Clear browser data when using shared computers

#### Project Data

1. **Local Backups**: Export important projects regularly
2. **Secure Sharing**: Be cautious when sharing project files
3. **Sensitive Content**: Avoid including sensitive information in projects

### Security Features

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)

- Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- Restricts script sources and inline execution
- Allows only necessary external resources

#### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- File uploads restricted to image formats only
- Text inputs properly escaped for display

#### Secure Communication

- All API communications use HTTPS
- No sensitive data transmitted to third parties
- Direct communication with Google APIs only

### Known Security Limitations

#### Client-Side Nature

- **Source Code Visible**: All code visible to users
- **Local Storage**: Data accessible via browser tools
- **No Server Validation**: All validation happens client-side

#### API Key Exposure

- **Developer Tools**: Keys visible in browser developer tools
- **Local Storage**: Keys stored in browser localStorage
- **Network Requests**: Keys visible in network requests

### Mitigation Strategies

#### For Users

1. **Use Dedicated Keys**: Create API keys specifically for Canvas AI Studio
2. **Monitor Usage**: Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud
3. **Regular Rotation**: Change API keys periodically
4. **Secure Environment**: Use the application in secure environments

#### For Developers

1. **Input Sanitization**: All inputs properly sanitized
2. **Error Handling**: Sensitive information not exposed in errors
3. **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration by default
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3-7**: Initial assessment and triage
4. **Day 8-30**: Investigation and fix development
5. **Day 31+**: Fix deployment and public disclosure

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:

- **Prioritized**: Released as soon as possible
- **Documented**: Included in CHANGELOG.md
- **Announced**: Via GitHub releases and security advisories
- **Backward Compatible**: When possible
